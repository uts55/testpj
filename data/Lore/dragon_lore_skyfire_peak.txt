Skyfire Peak, the tallest mountain in the Dragon's Tooth range, is perpetually wreathed in a crimson storm. It is said to be the ancestral roost of Ignis, the Great Red Dragon, whose fiery breath first scorched its peak millennia ago. Ancient pacts bind Ignis and his lineage to the mountain, and they are its fierce guardians. Legends claim that the heart of the mountain contains a vast hoard of treasures and knowledge, accumulated over eons by the dragonflights. Few have dared to venture close, and even fewer have returned. The air around the peak crackles with raw magical energy, and lesser drakes and wyverns patrol its slopes.
