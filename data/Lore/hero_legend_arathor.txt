Arathor the Just, a humble shepherd from the northern highlands, rose to prominence during the Age of Shadow when the Necrolord Xarthus threatened to plunge Aethel into eternal undeath. Arathor, wielding the Blade of Dawn - a gift from a disguised Lumina - rallied the scattered kingdoms. His courage was unwavering, his tactical genius unmatched. He led the final charge against Xarthus's fortress, sacrificing himself to seal the Necrolord within the Obsidian Crypt. Though he perished, his sacrifice ushered in an era of peace, and the Order of Arathor was founded to protect the realm from similar threats. His spirit is said to linger, offering guidance to those pure of heart.
