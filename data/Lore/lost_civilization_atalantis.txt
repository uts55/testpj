Before the rise of current human kingdoms, the enigmatic Atalan civilization flourished on an island continent in the Azure Sea. They were masters of water magic and crystal technology, building cities of breathtaking beauty that supposedly harnessed the very tides for power. Their scholars charted the stars and delved into secrets of the universe. Yet, overnight, Atalan vanished.

Their sunken cities and potent artifacts are now sought after by treasure hunters and scholars alike, though many are guarded by strange, aquatic sentinels.
