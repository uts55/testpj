In the epoch before time, only the Formless Void existed. From a flicker of cosmic will, the Twin Celestials, Lumina and Tenebris, were born. Lumina, with her breath of starlight, wove the fabric of the material plane, crafting suns, moons, and the myriad worlds. Tenebris, from the shadows between stars, carved the Spirit Veil, a realm of echoes and whispers, and in doing so, allowed the nascent energies of magic to seep into the world. Their first children, the Elemental Titans, shaped the lands and seas, their conflicts giving rise to the mountains and valleys of Aethel.
