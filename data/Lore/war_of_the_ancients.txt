The War of the Ancients, a cataclysm that spanned five centuries, pitted the technologically advanced Solar Empire of Eldoria against the nature-bound magic of the Sylvaneth Conclave. The Eldorians, wielding arcane machinery and sun-forged weapons, sought to impose their ordered dominion upon the 'chaotic' wilds. The Sylvaneth, commanding ancient beasts and the very forests themselves, resisted fiercely. The war culminated in the Great Sundering, a magical backlash that shattered continents, sunk Eldoria beneath the waves, and left scars upon the world that persist as volatile magic zones and cursed lands. Many ancient ruins and powerful, forgotten artifacts are remnants of this devastating conflict.
