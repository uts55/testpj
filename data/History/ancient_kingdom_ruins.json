    "text_content": "The Kingdom of Eldoria flourished for a thousand years, masters of artifice and elemental magic. Their sky-cities were wonders to behold. However, their ambition outstripped their wisdom. A magical cataclysm, brought on by their own hubris, shattered their civilization, leaving only scattered ruins and cautionary tales. Many explorers seek these ruins for lost knowledge and powerful artifacts, though most find only danger.",
